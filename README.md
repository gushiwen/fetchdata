# Fetch Data and Pagination

In this exercise, I tried to fetch data from remote data source by axios. <br />

Customized hook useDataApi to maintain states, and it's reusable as well. <br />

useReducer is good for managing multiple states and complicated logics, I applied it in the program. <br />

<App> is the main component, <Pagination> is the child component, both helped to display paginated items on the browser. <br />
